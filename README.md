Deep Learning for Genomics

This project explores DNA sequence-based binary classification using deep learning models. The goal is to understand how neural networks can learn patterns in genomic data and evaluate the effectiveness of different model architectures and sequence encodings.

Key Highlights

Implemented Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sequence classification

Explored multiple nucleotide encoding strategies: label encoding, one-hot encoding, and FCGR

Ensured reproducibility using fixed random seeds and stratified train/validation/test splits

Evaluated models with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices

Conducted depth and activation function studies to analyze training dynamics and overfitting

Developed fully annotated Colab notebook with code, plots, and explanations

Tools & Technologies
